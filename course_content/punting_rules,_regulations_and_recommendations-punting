1. What consequences does the punting team facing if they touch the football first after it's been punted?

    A) The punting team gets a penalty.
    - Incorrect. Touching the ball first by the punting team doesn't result in a penalty.
      
    B) The receiving team can choose where to start their next drive.
    - Correct. This is referred to as the "spot of first touching," the receiving team can decide to take possession where the ball was first touched.
      
    C) The play is whistled dead and they lose possession.
    - Incorrect. The play doesn't automatically end if the punting team touches the football first. The receiving team also has the chance to attempt a return.

2. Which situation is best suited for a 'pooch punt'?

    A) When the team is on the edge of its own end zone and needs to punt the ball far downfield.
    - Incorrect. Pooch punts are not normally punted for long distances. 

    B) When the team is penetrating deep into the opponent's territory and wants to confine them near their own end zone.
    - Correct. Pooch punts are used to control the ball's placement, effectively pinning the opponent near their own end zone.

    C) When the team is trying to cross the maximum distance in an open field.
    - Incorrect. Pooch punts are intended for precision, not distance. They're used to restrict the returning team to their own territory.

1. What happens according to the rules if a player signals for a fair catch but the kicking team interferes?

    A) The kicking team is awarded a penalty.
    - Correct. If the kicking team interferes after a fair catch signal, a penalty known as "fair catch interference" is awarded against them.

    B) The game continues without any penalty.
    - Incorrect. The rules of the game state that the kicking team must not interfere once a fair catch is signaled. The violation of this rule leads to a penalty known as "fair catch interference."

    C) The receiving team loses possession of the ball.
    - Incorrect. Interference by the kicking team after a fair catch signal doesn’t cause the receiving team to lose possession. Instead, a penalty is awarded against the kicking team.


1. Imagine a game scenario. Your team is on defense and the opposition is punting. As a coach, when would you advise your players it's legal to tackle the opposing team's punter?

    A) Once the ball has left the foot of the punter
    - Incorrect. The punter is considered defenseless once the ball is kicked. Any contact with the punter after the kick may result in a penalty for "roughing the kicker". This rule exists to protect the punters from injury, given their vulnerable position during and after the kick.

    
    B) Only if the punter possesses the ball and has converted into a runner or if a blocked punt is recoverable in the air in front of the line of scrimmage
    - Correct. It is only legal to tackle the punter when they become a runner or in case of a blocked punt that can be recovered in mid-air in front of the line of scrimmage. Emphasizing these rules with your players helps protect all athletes on the field.

    
    C) Whether the punter has the ball, is kicking it, or has already kicked it doesn’t matter, you can tackle him
    - Incorrect. Tackling the punter without regards to the game scenario can lead to penalties and compromise the safety of the punter. As a coach, you have a responsibility to ensure your players understand and respect these rules.

1. Under NFL rules, at what point following a snap is it permitted for a defensive player to make contact with the punt snapper?

    A) Immediately after the snap.
    - Incorrect. Defensive players cannot hit the snapper immediately after the snap. There's a window of time that must pass before contact is allowed.
    
    B) Half a second after the snap.
    - Incorrect. This time frame would still be too soon for a defensive player to engage with the punt snapper. The NFL rules specify a specific time that must elapse.
    
    C) One second after the snap.
    - Correct. According to NFL rules, a defensive player cannot hit the snapper until one second has passed since the snap.

2. In terms of positioning on the line of scrimmage, which is the correct action for a defensive player during a punt attempt?

   A) Lining up directly opposite the snapper.
   - Incorrect. This positioning would not be in accordance with the NFL rules about contact with the punt snapper.
   
   B) Lining up to the side of the snapper.
   - Correct. Defensive players cannot line up directly across from the punt snapper during a field goal or punt attempt.
   
   C) Lining up behind the snapper.
   - Incorrect. This position would not be practical or in line with standard defensive setup for a punt play.

1. When can the players in a punting team start blocking their opponents, and why is this timing important?

    A) Before the ball is snapped, to disrupt the opponent's formation early
    - Incorrect. Blocking before the ball is snapped is against the rules. It's crucial to understand the right timing to avoid penalties.
  
    B) As soon as the ball is snapped, to prevent the opponents from reaching the punter
    - Correct. It is crucial for the blocking to start as soon as the ball is snapped to protect the punter and allow them sufficient time to make the punt.
    
    C) After the punter has kicked the ball, to clear the way for the punt to travel
    - Incorrect. Waiting until after the punt would risk a blocked punt. Players should start blocking as soon as the ball is snapped to protect the punter effectively.

1. When should the blocking time period of the punting team's front line end?

    A) Immediately after the ball is snapped
    - Incorrect. Blocking is indeed initiated at the snap but should not end here. If the blockers disengage this early, the punter becomes highly vulnerable to an incoming rush from the opposing team.

    B) As soon as the punter kicks the football
    - Correct. The blocking team is responsible for maintaining the protection from the moment the ball is snapped till it is kicked away by the punter. This ensures sufficient time to punt the football without any interference from the opposing team.

    C) After the punter has run a number of yards with the ball 
    - Incorrect. The punter is not expected to run with the football under normal circumstances. His main duty is to kick the ball as quickly as possible after the long snap. Therefore, blocking needs to be accomplished until the punt rather than any potential running play.

Question 1. As part of the punt shield, what is your primary responsibility?

    A) Ensure the punt is accurate
    - Incorrect. The accuracy of the punt is the punter's responsibility. The punt shield's task pertains more to what happens before the kick.

    B) Block any direct rush from opposing players
    - Correct. The main task of the punt shield is to prevent any direct rush from the opposing players. This protective action allows the punter to safely complete his kick.

    C) Run downfield to tackle returners
    - Incorrect. The primary duty of tackling returners usually falls onto the gunners or other members of the special teams unit, not the punt shield.
